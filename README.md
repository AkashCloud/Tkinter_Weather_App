.exe of this application is available but little big in size because i made this exe by using pyinstaller.

if you freeze and made exe the size will be very less, i will do this for my editor application, available in github.

If you want .exe file of this Weather gui, please click on the link below for open EXE folder in google drive and search inside that folder for WeatherApp.exe...
